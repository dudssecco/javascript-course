# ðŸ”¹ JavaScript & Node.js Course

This repository contains the material and projects from a course I completed, where I dove deep into JavaScript and Node.js. It's the place where I transformed "Hello World" into actual functionality. Expect some real-life examples and code snippets that helped me become proficient in the JavaScript ecosystem and back-end development using Node.js.

If you think this course was just about console logs and callbacks, youâ€™re in for a treat.

## Technologies Utilized:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
